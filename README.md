This is a personal project being developed and maintained for devices running on Android. It capitalizes on sensors and utilities on Android smartphones. One overaching goal I'm on a quest to achieve is clean code and clean design. As this is my first real app I'm out to document and explain code/features. Also a clean/vibrant/picture based UI is used to make using the app simple and easy. So far the following features have been developed:
- Sound Decibel Reading
- Ambient Air Temperature Sensor
- Light Sensor
- Available Ram Detection
- Battery Temperature Sensor
- Accelerometer Tracker
- Atmospheric Pressure Gauge
- Humidity Sensor
- Step Counter

## Feature in progress
- Notifcations for certain sensors (i.e alerts for when battery becomes too hot)
- User editable settings to alert them at certain unit amounts

## Language Support
Support is included for the following languages:
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Indonesian

There will be future support for more languages beyond what's currently offered.

## Future Plans
There's a world of features I'd like to implement into this app over time. Here's a couple:
- Make a leveler and determine balance
- Provide analogies to help explain readings
- Background notifications
- Custom notification sound alerts
- A list of all currently available sensors on a device
- Smooth animations
- Localize throughout the world

## Beta
This app is currently in Beta for testing/feedback. During this phase I'll also add language support along with optimization.
