This is a personal project being developed and maintained for devices running on Android. It capitalizes on sensors and utilities on Android smartphones. One overaching goal I'm on a quest to achieve is clean code and clean design. As this is my first real app I'm out to document and explain code/features. Also a clean/vibrant/picture based UI is used to make using the app simple and easy. So far the following features have been developed:
- Sound Decibel Reading
- Ambient Air Temperature Sensor
- Light Sensor
- Available Ram Detection
- Battery Temperature Sensor
- Accelerometer Tracker

## Future Plans
There's a world of features I'd like to implement into this app over time. Here's a couple:
- Make a leveler and determine balance
- Calculate Humidity
- Measure Pressure
- Provide analogies to help explain readings
- Sound effects or vibrations to happen with user configured preferences
- Backgound notifications
- A list of all currently available sensors on a device
- Smooth animations

## Beta
This app will be launched onto the Google Play Store in the near future for testing/feedback. I'll provide a link once it is launched.
