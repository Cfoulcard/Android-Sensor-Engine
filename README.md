📱 The Android Sensor Engine is an open source app designed and engineered to utilize your Android phone's sensors. 

This is a project being developed and maintained for devices running on Android. It capitalizes on sensors and utilities on Android smartphones. One overarching goal I'm on a quest to achieve is clean code and clean design. A clean/vibrant/picture based UI is used to make using the app simple and easy. You could say I'm helping UI fall in love with UX. So far the following features have been developed:
- Sound Decibel Reading 🔊
- Ambient Air Temperature Sensor ♨
- Light Sensor 💡
- Available Ram Detection 💽
- Battery Temperature Sensor 🔥
- Accelerometer Tracker 🏎
- Atmospheric Pressure Gauge 🌎
- Humidity Sensor 💧
- Step Counter 👟
