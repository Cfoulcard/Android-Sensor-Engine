This is a project being developed and maintained for devices running on Android. It capitalizes on sensors and utilities on Android smartphones. One overaching goal I'm on a quest to achieve is clean code and clean design. A clean/vibrant/picture based UI is used to make using the app simple and easy. You could say I'm helping UI fall in love with UX. So far the following features have been developed:
- Sound Decibel Reading
- Ambient Air Temperature Sensor
- Light Sensor
- Available Ram Detection
- Battery Temperature Sensor
- Accelerometer Tracker
- Atmospheric Pressure Gauge
- Humidity Sensor
- Step Counter

## Country Availability
This app is currently available in 83 countries throughout the world

## Language Support
Support is included for the following languages:
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Indonesian

There will be future support for more languages beyond what's currently offered.

## Future Plans
There's a world of features I'd like to implement into this app over time. Here's a couple:
- Add elevation
- Provide analogies to help explain readings
- Service side notifications 
- Custom notification sound alerts
- A list of all currently available sensors on a device
- Smooth animations and a more "vibrantly" lively experience
- Localize throughout the world

## Beta
This app is currently in Beta for testing/feedback. During this phase I'll also add language support along with various optimization.

## Other info
This project is built using Java, Kotlin, and XML. Designs were made/modified in Affinity Designer.
